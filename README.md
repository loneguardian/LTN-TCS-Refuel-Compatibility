LTN: [Logistic Train Network](https://mods.factorio.com/mods/Optera/LogisticTrainNetwork)

TCS: [Train Control Signals](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Train_Control_Signals)

If you do not know either of the mods above, then this mod is not for you.

Are you an LTN user but wishes to implement a separate centralised refuel station using TCS? This mod addresses that.

## What this mod DOES?
- Adds an additional stop to the end of the schedule of an LTN train after delivery pickup is complete. The stop name contains the TCS Refuel station virtual signal by default.

## Additional instructions
- Station name and inactivity timeout can be configured through mod settings (under Map tab).
- Make sure that the LTN setting - "Delivery completes at requester" is disabled.

## What this mod DOES NOT DO?
- DOES NOT change any refuel behaviours of train.
- DOES NOT interact with the depot function of TCS.
